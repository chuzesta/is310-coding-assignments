The Fandom Wiki that I am scraping is the Adventure Time Fandom Wiki. ADventure Time is an animated fantasy show that aired on Cartoon network for much of my childhood. Some may say that this show is a children's show, and they would be right to an extent. However, this is a show that has the ability to appeal to most age ranges and has mature and thought provoking themes that are consistently covered, as well as interesting and boundary pushing artistic elements. It was my favorite show as a kid, and still a show I hold in very high regard. I scraped basic character information for every single character that was in the characters list of the wiki. The information scraped includes the name, aliases, age, species, occupation, and the episodes they were introduced in and last seen in, as well as more. This information would be useful for researchers if they wanted to explore the world building and distribution of character types in the show. There are over 1300 characters in the show, and seeing general information laid out in this way could help us understand the chronology and development of the adventure time world.
